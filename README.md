Objective

The goal of this project is to build a web-based plagiarism detection tool that compares a user‚Äôs input text with the content of a reference document and identifies similarities. It helps in detecting copied or duplicated content using NLP and machine learning techniques.

üîπ Key Features

Web Interface (Flask App)

Users can enter a text snippet into a web form.

The application compares this text with the content of a reference file (document.txt).

Displays whether the input text is plagiarized along with a similarity score.

Text Normalization

Input text and reference text are normalized for better comparison:

Converted to lowercase.

Tokenized into words.

Punctuation removed.

Stopwords are kept to preserve context (important for plagiarism detection).

Plagiarism Detection

Uses TF-IDF (Term Frequency‚ÄìInverse Document Frequency) to represent text.

Uses Cosine Similarity to measure similarity between input and reference text.

A threshold (0.3 in this code) is used to decide if plagiarism is detected.

Plagiarism with Document File

Reads the entire document.txt file.

Compares user‚Äôs input with the whole document.

Returns:

‚úÖ Plagiarized (if similarity ‚â• threshold)

‚ùå Not Plagiarized (if similarity < threshold).

Browser Auto-Open

The app automatically opens in the browser when started.

üîπ Technologies Used

Python ‚Äì Main programming language.

Flask ‚Äì For building the web interface.

NLTK ‚Äì For text tokenization and stopwords.

Scikit-learn ‚Äì For TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity.

HTML (Jinja templates) ‚Äì For displaying results in the browser.

üîπ Workflow

User enters a text in the input box.

Application loads a reference document (document.txt).

Both texts are normalized (lowercased, tokenized, punctuation removed).

TF-IDF is applied to extract text features.

Cosine similarity is calculated between input and reference document.

If similarity ‚â• 0.3 ‚Üí plagiarism detected.

Result is displayed on the web page with similarity score.

üîπ Example

Reference document (document.txt):
Artificial Intelligence is transforming industries worldwide.

User Input 1:
AI is transforming industries worldwide.

Normalized Texts ‚Üí similar word distribution.

Similarity Score ‚Üí 0.82 (high).

Result: ‚úÖ Plagiarized

User Input 2:
The cat sat on the mat.

Very different from document.

Similarity Score ‚Üí 0.05

Result: ‚ùå Not Plagiarized
